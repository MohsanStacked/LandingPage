```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the production-ready files.

## Linting

```

npm run lint

```
or with yarn:
```

yarn lint

```

## Preview Production Build
To preview the production build locally:
```

npm run preview

```
or with yarn:
```

yarn preview

```

## Adding New Components or Pages

- Add new pages in the `src/pages/` directory.
- For API-related functionality, use the `src/api/` directory.
- Place global styles in `src/App.css` or `src/index.css`.
- Add new utility functions in the `src/utils/` directory.

## Configuration
